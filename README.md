# Hands-On Learning
Forging opportunities for hands on learning through reconceived schooling.

## Motivation
> Are you frustrated by the devolution of contemporary schooling?

I certainly am.

My name is Mark Campanelli. I am a parent of two middle school kids. I
have grown despondent with the current state of "modern" public schooling.

I see my kids struggle to find connection to the real world with "math facts",
meaningless computerized homework, and endless preparation for standardized tests.

I see burnt out teachers who have given in to the worst habits forged by a system that
forgets that education exists to serve *humans*.

I see YouTube videos that uncover every corner of our wonderful world to curious kids,
while those same kids struggle with excessive hands-off screentime and the
all-too-prevelant isolation, banality, or cruelty of social media.

I see an educational system that almost entirely misses the mark in its mission
to forge a connection between individuals' pursuit of happiness and their talents, and
society's need for critical thinkers, ceative and efficient workers, and informed
voters.

## The Idea

> I know there is another way.

To really learn, many kids need to build things, experiment, play rough, and
challenge themselves and their peers through both competition and cooperation. This is
particularly true for boys, who are incresingly "checking out" of zombified contemporary
schooling.

Kids learn by doing, not by sitting and memorizing "math facts" or endless computerized
"competency assessments". The adults are merely a guiding presence in this exploration.

Think instead of a shop class lasting the whole day rather than one period for one
6-week elective.

Think of kids building concrete porfolios of successes and failures, instead of merely
doing everything for a report card and because it's "needed in the next grade".

It's time for an alternative to our outdated approach to schools, which is downright
inhumane to many kids and their teachers. It's also largely a waste of the parents' and
taxpayers' money.

I am in the concept stages of establishing a new school based around a *hands-on*
approach to learning.
