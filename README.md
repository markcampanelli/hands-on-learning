# Hands-On Schooling
Forging opportunities for hands-on learning through reconceived schooling.

## Motivation
> Are you frustrated by the devolution of contemporary schooling?

I certainly am.

My name is Mark Campanelli. I am a parent of two middle school kids. I have grown
utterly despondent with the current state of "modern" schooling.

I see my kids struggle to find connection to the real world with "math facts",
meaningless computerized homework, and endless preparation for standardized tests.

I see burnt out teachers who have given in to the worst habits forged by a system that
has forgotten that education exists to serve *humanity*, not vice versa.

I see YouTube videos that humorously uncover nearly every corner of our wonderful world
to curious kids, while those same kids struggle with excessive hands-off screentime and
the all-too-prevelant isolation, banality, or cruelty of social media.

I see an educational system that almost entirely misses the mark in its mission
to forge a connection between individuals' pursuit of happiness using thier talents and
society's desperate need for critical thinkers, entrepreneurs, ceative and efficient
workers, and informed voters.

## The Idea

> I imagine there is another way.

To really learn, many kids need to build things, experiment, play rough, and
challenge themselves and their peers through both competition and cooperation. This is
particularly true for boys, who are incresingly "checking out" of zombified contemporary
schooling.

Kids learn best by doing, not by sitting and memorizing "content" or taking endless
"competency assessments". The teachers are the external guiding presence in this
exploration, and they include parents, community members, and especially other kids.

Think of a shop class lasting several hours each day, rather than one 40-minute
period each day for one 6-week elective during one whole school year.

Think of a teacher breaking down a build project into teams of kids, with individualized
tasks for each kid on each team.

Think of a kid accruing a concrete porfolio of successes and failures, instead of merely
doing everything for a report card or because "it's needed in the next grade".

It's time for an alternative to our expired approach to schooling, which is downright
inhumane to many kids and their teachers. It's also largely a waste of the parents' and
taxpayers' money.

I'm in the concept stages of establishing a new school based around a *hands-on*
approach to learning, and I welcome your help.
